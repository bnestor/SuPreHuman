OPbody:I’ve felt like that for a very long time. I had an attempt a few years ago and I’m starting to get into that mind space again. I kinda half ass tried the other week by cutting myself deep where I know there’s an artery, but I couldn’t go deep enough and just ended up with 36 stitches and a messed up tendon. 

I just have this feeling that my life will end by my own hand. I don’t know if it will be soon, or if it will be years down the line, but I’m convinced that’s how I will die. That’s how I’m fated to die. 

I’m trying a new medication but it hasn’t been very long and I’m feeling bad. I have people that give a shit about me, but I can’t bring myself to reach out to them. I don’t want to burden them. I know how much it would hurt people close to me if I did kill myself... but I’m in so much pain. I want it to stop. 

There are times when I do feel happy, but at the end of the day I always have this ‘voice’ in the back of my head telling me how worthless I am and to just kill myself because that’s what I’m supposed to do. It’s getting harder and harder to not listen to it. 
id:e8xitat, comment author:nilherm, body:I don't think I've ever read someone else's post that so accurately sounds exactly the way I feel. I just... Yeah I feel almost exactly the same. When I was inpatient and the nurses would try to ask me why I was suicidal I had such a hard time explaining to them that it's not to escape anything or because I was upset with my situation . I just *feel* inside me that I'm *supposed* to. 

Anyway, thank you for posting and sharing. I'm so sorry you feel this torment. I understand it. I hope your new med helps a bit., ups:19, downs:0, parent:9tm2p8

id:e8xz01t, comment author:Raptor450, body:I can really relate. Even when I'm in an ok mood I just see that whatever I do it will end in suicide.

id:e8y2xdq, comment author:leturtlewhisperer, body:I struggled with this kind of thinking too. Sometimes the brain gets stuck in this infinite loop of thinking about certain things, like suicide. Even watching something on TV or hearing something about a suicide attempt can get my brain going on this cycle which is very frustrating for me. "Thought-stopping" is helpful when I get into this space - I try to shut down any thoughts of suicide that pop into my head and think about something else. I also try to keep busy so that my idle mind doesn't start thinking about it. I know that this is much easier said than done, though. It can feel so overpowering.
I'd also like to say that your loved ones probably will not look at you as a burden if you open up. If they're truly caring and decent people, they will hopefully want to support you and be thankful that you are trying to keep yourself safe by reaching out.

id:e8y8zvo, comment author:Kylerj96, body:If it helps, I think destiny is bullshit. I know that might sound depressing, but it's true and it's freeing to realize. I'm pretty sure I believed I was destined to die by my own hand too. To be honest I think I still believe I will some days. But it's not because god, or the universe, or whoever said I was going to. It will be my decision. I'm trying not to, but it's getting harder for me as well, life's throwing a lot my way. I hope we both decide to say "fuck destiny" and be what we want to be. I don't know if this will be at all helpful to you. I just want you to know that you control your destiny. If you're not strong enough, you can become stronger. If you earn a better life, that will be YOURS, no one elses. And i truly hope you don't kill yourself, but if you do, that will be yours too.

id:e8yecu4, comment author:Thereallittlejj2, body:I feel the same way. I am sorry that this is our life.

Mine is somewhat situational.

I was dating a man for four years in an LDR. He was very nice to me and never yelled. However, he had an odd, passive temper and if I said anything that he didn't 100% agree while I was away from him, he would suddenly block my number, leaving me considering possibilities that he might be dead, etc. until he would speak to me again.

He also made me hide the relationship the entire time so that it only existed to us. To his friends and family, he was single. I've been for loops and loops in his car while he tried to find a restaurant where his friends were not eating for us to have lunch.

He never wanted me to mention his name to anyone. I was allowed to say that I had a boyfriend, but that was it. He refused to meet my mother. He would never sign a document that had my name on it already. I never snoop on people's phones, but he would never leave his phone around me and rarely answered a call in my presence.

I put up with all of his weird rules because he was very sweet otherwise. He planned to marry me, but he said that the church had to be empty so that no one would see.

Finally, one day, he suddenly dumped me by text and blocked my number. It literally kills me that I went through this for four years and he couldn't even listen to me for less than four minutes at the break-up.  On top of that, he may never have broken up if he would have let me speak that day - the text alluded to distance as one of the main reasons for the break-up, but that day, I was going to tell him that my job was allowing me to see him more next year.

People always say that it is manipulative when a jilted lover tries to commit suicide. However, in my case, I have become so intertwined with him due to his weird rules and the things that we enjoyed together that I seriously feel lost and incapable of living any other way. I would never be able to have another lover because I don't even know what is real and what is not. Our relationship was secret in person and only by text and phone otherwise. Because I've been blocked by our only communication, our relationship has been erased.

I simply cannot cope with having four years of my life erased and I am trying to find my way out of this life., ups:2, downs:0, parent:9tm2p8

Please tell your mum you're suicidal/depressed and because she loves you she will get you help...you only need to reach out once and tell the right person and you can jumpstart a route to happiness.

id:e8ydhm5, comment author:valiantvalencia, body:16 is a rough age for a lot of people. It's very often the age when depression comes out for the first time. 

in your post, you used a lot of very negative descriptions of yourself and seemed to think that no one would miss you if you died. These probably feel like cruel reality, but please remember these are all classic signs of depression. It's your brain malfunctioning and shouting cruel things at you. Depression is an enemy that is so hard to fight even for people that are much older than you. Don't feel bad for having trouble dealing with it by yourself. It's good you posted here talking about it. It's tough to talk about for a lot of people.

You mentioned not wanting to see your mom be sad. It sounds like you care about each other a lot. What do you think might happen if you told her some of the things you felt that you talked about here? Sometimes people hide what they're feeling from their loved ones because they're afraid that opening up will make their loved one sad, but talking to someone who cares about you is the first step for a lot of people to feeling better. No one should have to fight these feelings on their own.

OPbody:Graduated in 2013 with this kid. I wasnt close with him in school, and we haven't talked since graduation so I definitely didnt know him well. That being said our class was only about 100 people so everyone knew everyone somewhat. Anyway, I have been seeing some other classmates post things on Facebook. Some write paragraph long condolences and encouraging others to reach out if they need help. Others just share the obituary. 
Many of the people posting on facebook weren't close to him and are merely making this tragedy about them imo. As someone who has lived with depression for years I can say so many of these people are full of shit.
People know I'm depressed,  and friends will help if I ask. Just once I want someone to reach out to me, to see how I'm doing so I dont feel like im interfering with someone's day over my personal problems.
Yea people are sad that our classmate died. I am too. But I also know so many of them are speaking out of their ass when talk like they want to help. In reality they want the other person to be happy, but they can stop acting like they are gonna take time out of their day to reach out.
Maybe I'm just cynical. Maybe everyone was reaching out to him. It's a tragedy that he died, but dont make it your tragedy if you haven't talked since high school.

It’s becoming so easy for him to just ignore me. I’ll lash out for his attention , then say I’m sorry, just ignore me, I know I’m being crazy. He can lock his phone and immediately forget about me. Meanwhile I’m tearing myself apart with self hatred, staring at the messages waiting for him to say something while sobbing my eyes out. I mean nothing to the only person I have.

OPbody:My whole life I wanted to belong and to be a normal person. I never was though and always had issues. I hate myself a lot of the time and feel like I'm going crazy a lot of the time. I obsess over stupid things like my appearance to the point of having massive anxiety about it and I self harm to cope with all of the anxiety I have. I've been having anxiety attacks so often lately that I feel miserable when I wake up. I also have a problem being social, I am awkward and don't talk a lot, this makes me an outcast. The only time I go out of my house is to go to work, it's a small job and all of my co-workers hang out with each other but I do not because I can't talk well to people and feel left out. Especially since it's a small group and they all know each other but I am simply an employee. I am a 29/f and have been like this all my life, I have really tried to improve and feel like I'm old enough now to make a decision to not be here.
id:e8yet8q, comment author:HomerFong, body:>My whole life I wanted to belong and to be a normal person.

Just wanted you to know I empathize with that statement.  It's hard trying to live and survive in a world where you simply do not fit in, and it seems nobody really wants you around.  I'm sorry you are suffering so much, but maybe give things a bit more time to improve.  I had some good experiences in my 30s, not many, but some.  It didn't really fully all go to shit until I got into my early 40s., ups:1, downs:0, parent:9tqkd2
id:e8yfqye, comment author:HideAllSpoons, body:Hi!

I don't think you're unfixable. I think what you need most is to feel better about yourself and gain more confidence. Some people who obsess over their image have a distorted view of themselves and don't even realize that they're actually attractive.

&#x200B;

I'm 30/m and also never felt like I belonged, pretty much my whole life.

Maybe your social anxiety comes down to the same thing - confidence. I myself have difficulty connecting to normal people now on anything but a superficial level. One thing that has helped me significantly though was to find people online I could relate to, and level out my insecurities and weaknesses. Maybe doing the same could benefit you too. Starting someplace small and safe can eventually translate into real world situations, as well as give you a fallback position when things don't go well.

&#x200B;

And yeah, of course you're old enough to make up your mind, but I don't think your situation is hopeless or you are doomed to forever be an outcast from what you wrote. If you're feeling disconnected from the people around you, maybe you just need to connect with some people who  get you.

This morning was the closest I had come to trying to kill myself in close to four months. I was headed to work, waiting at the light to turn onto the freeway. The thought came to my mind. The light turned green, and I sat there for a good 20 seconds, really struggling not to turn into oncoming traffic on the freeway. The impulse was so strong. I feel that sometime soon I'll make that fatal choice. A large part of me longs for it. I feel like I'm already dead and my body just needs to catch up.

OPbody:Within the last 32 hours I've taken 44 painkillers of differing varieties and had about 8 pints of cider and a lot of Jack Daniels. I was taking tablets all throughout my shift at work and could feel my heart starting to explode. I was fully prepared for tonight to be my last.
I had though about it all day, what I was going to do when I got home: go for a long walk and drown myself in the local fish farm ponds after pounding drinks and more tablets. I was ready, excited for it. Then I get home, start writing my notes for the people I'd leave, making them  happier since they wouldn't have to put up with my bullshit any longer but I hear my mum crying. Mum has been dealing with a lot of work related issues lately and she was supposed to have a long weekend off for our birthday (both born on the 4th November) but she'd been told she has to work Monday and Tuesday since "she isn't doing anything those two days". She was inconsolable, I havn't seen her like that in a long time, so I had to try and help her in any way I could.

OPbody:While I was in highschool, the constant interaction coupled with my long distance girlfriend gave me loads of energy. I would get on Xbox and be yelling out the attack names on NarutoStorm with my friends, and IRL I made alot of people smile with how I acted. Well, I graduated highschool, and couldn't keep up keeping in contact with my friends. My girlfriend and I broke up, and my grandma killed herself before the end of the year. Around the same time, my mom's bipolar disorder got out of control. She started doing drugs and I had to practically babysit her. It ended with her falling asleep at the wheel of my car and busting in the headlight. This whole time, I've just been in my room playing Dragonball Fighterz. I work at FedEx too and have to wake up at 2am everyday. When I go in to work, everyone asks if I'm ok. People all around me have this inside joke about my depression and how it reflects off my face. I honestly have no idea what to do. I've never been in a face to face relationship, and feel like I've lost myself in the depression anyways.

OPbody:I know people often say that people who commit suicide aren't thinking clearly, they can't see a way out, they are in unbearable pain, they think they are a burden, that no one will care, or no one will notice.

I know my mental illness is definitely a huge factor in why I want to die. The thing is, I'm just tired. I'm tired of struggling and trying. I know there are things that I haven't tried, changes I could make... Sometimes the pain is unbearable and I might hurt myself in those times but I don't have the ability for enough rational thought to carry out any kind of plan. I am a burden but that really bothers me far more than anyone else. There aren't a ton of people who will notice or care but they do exist. 

The thing is, I'm just really tired. I just don't want to keep trying.

I wonder if the same is for you.

My partner posted this quote:  

>The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.

I find this to be true.. Maybe it really does apply to those of us who are exhausted beyond belief. People do love and care for us but right now... All I can see is how worn out I am.

OPbody:I'm really scared to post this, I'm scared the comments will make me really sad.

I have someone in my life that's been kind of like a second mom for me. Shes been there for me, and im super greatful. But sometimes she is so busy she says she will read things i say later (we chat) but then forgets, and i remind her, and she says soon, forgets etc etc. This has made me super insecure sometimes, cause it makes me feel unimportant. Which.. I am. But its still sad for me. 

But now she is in a tough situation herself. I'm being supportive, but im still having a hard time myself. Ive told her im sorry im still like this, but she says she still wants to hear about me too. And i talked to her a bit about my suicidal thoughts, which is something ive never dared talk much about. I asked her if she was sure i could tell her more about this, and she said yes. So finally i did. I told almost everything. It took a lot for me to do so.

But ofcourse the same thing happens as always when its something important. She got super busy, and has now not read it for days, a week soon.

This time it hit alot harder for me, cause i really needed to be taken seriously. I know that now after the fact, and knowing how things are i should have never talked about it at all. But the hurt feeling is still there. It feels so bad, cause this was so hard for me.

I know im probably being super selfish. Im just hurt by this.
id:e8xxcjw, comment author:IfYouHaveGhosts824, body:First of all, I'm really sorry for what you're going through. Opening up to somebody about depression and suicidal thoughts is one of the most intimidating things a person can possibly do, and you did it. Regardless of the outcome, you should be extremely proud of yourself. That type of strength and tenacity is exactly the type of thing that's going to get you through this. 

Even if your second mom doesn't respond to you right away, it doesn't mean she doesn't care. It doesn't mean she's not taking it seriously. Life gets in the way sometimes, especially if she works a lot. She probably cares immensely about you, and for all you know, she could be thinking about you right this second. She could be thinking of what she wants to say to you, before she actually gets back to you. Please don't take it personally. I'm guilty of not responding to people right away, and I think most of us are, if we're being perfectly honest. 

In the event that she doesn't take it seriously, you should make it absolutely clear to her that you need to be taken seriously. Make it absolutely clear that you need to talk to her about this and that you need her support. Ask her if she's ever felt the same way. Ask her if she's ever been in your situation before, or if there's anything she can do to help you. Depression can be difficult for people to understand if they've never gone through it personally. Nevertheless, I guarantee she loves you and cares about you, and I guarantee she would much rather help you than have to bury you. 

Remember that your feelings matter as much as anybody else's. You're not being “selfish” at all. You deserve to be heard. You deserve to be taken seriously. You have a right to live a long, happy, healthy life, just like everybody else does. If there are other people you can reach out to for support, I'd strongly suggest you do so. You may find you're not as alone as you think, because there are many people – including myself – who know exactly what you're going through. 

If you need to vent or talk about what you're feeling, you're more than welcome to message me anytime. I know there's no easy answers to the problems you face, but I hope you can find it within you to keep pushing forward. I wish you all the best in the days ahead. You can do this – I believe in you!, ups:1, downs:0, parent:9toih1

OPbody:I'm Paula, I'm still in high school

I've been diagnosed for about two years now and everything had been semi okay but now I've been really getting urges to just end it

Normally when I'd get these kind of thoughts I'd dissuade them, I'd remind myself that I have parents and family and friends that love me and that I personally wouldn't want to do that to them


But lately I've just been angrier and lashing out and I've said things that have ended poorly and in fights but I just don't learn and I feel so awful for making the people who actually want to spend time with me feel like shit


I'm just so tired nowadays, not in a sleepy way but 
I don't want to keep doing this, I know there's no future for me, my friends are dropping me one by one (I've already lost two and due to recent behavior I think I'm going to lose another)


At this point it's just pure misery, sometimes I'll laugh or have a nice moment but it always defaults to sadness and vacancy and I can't stop it and the meds aren't helping anymore


They used to help I used to be happier I had some down moments but I was happier and now they've stopped and I don't want to die but I don't want to be alive anymore, I've considered throwing myself down the stairs or just causing serious harm to myself so I could just be in a hospital and not have to go to school, people wouldn't expect anything from me then I'd just be the girl in the hospital


I used to be so positive but I can't do this anymore and I just can't talk to anyone else about this because it's selfish of me to make them worry like this, they have their own problems to worry about and mine are just smaller in comparison


I've disliked myself since about second grade and there hasn't been a reason, I was never bullied and my family loves me and I've had friends in a cool and good grades and I consider myself to be at least average looking but nothing changes how I feel, friends and family alike say kind things about me to my face but it doesn't change a thing 


And I feel so terrible because people are trying and nothing works and I don't want to make anyone feel useless because it isn't their fault


I'm home alone right now with my brother and there is a medicine cabinet full of pills and god it's tempting, I don't think i could go through with it but it's tempting and I deserve it because I can't even be a good friend


They all left me for a reason and it has to be me


im so sorry to whoever had to read this mess im just in a bad place right now and i had to let it out

OPbody:I'm done with life and it's pain. If it weren't for my pets, I would've died years ago, but while I'm grateful for that and love them all more than anything else in the world, I probably should've died a few years back. I contribute nothing to the world. I'm a nobody who can't do a single thing right. Everyone treats me like an old piece of paper: stepped on, used and crumbled up, and thrown out. I deserve it though. I pretty much only deserve everything horrible that life has ever tossed my way. But I've hit my limit. I can't take another second of heartache. I'm doing this world a favor by taking myself out.

I'm debating whether I should leave a note. I have no one who would want to read it though. I mean, I'm not the best at writing things anyway, especially since this is one of the most cliché and unoriginal posts ever, so maybe it's a good thing that no one would read my note.

I don't want to scar others by hanging myself in my own home. Leaving that horrible sight to my pets and family isn't something I'd ever dare to do. So, the sun rises in a little over two hours where I'm at. I'll head to the woods around then I think. It would be a beautiful time to leave this world. The fresh orange sky and the puffy rain clouds heading their way.

From one anonymous stranger to another, thank you all for providing me with an outlet before I go. I know my post is long and all over the place but that's quite like my brain. Anyway, to those who are sad, I hope you have an amazing day and I hope that one day you can achieve true happiness on life. To everyone else, I hope you have an amazing day as well.

Lastly, to my pets, even though you can't read, I need to say this to you all. Thank you for saving me even on days when I didn't want to be. I'm sorry to leave. I love you all more than you could ever dream possible. 

I know that's lame and judge me all you want for that, but I desperately needed to just have that out there. And before anyone asks, I have people lined up to take care of my pets after I go. It was a promise made long ago by some family.

OPbody:I'm not brave enough to kill myself. I'm not man enough to kill myself.

I don't understand it. I know that I will just be gone. I'll just blend with Earth. I'm not scared of Hell. I'm not scared of the unknown. I'm not scared of possible pain that will come with whatever method I use to kill myself. 

The things that do scare me won't matter when I'm dead. I won't even know they are happening, or not happening. It won't matter that no one will notice I'm gone. It won't matter that no one cared enough to try to stop me. It won't matter that no one recognizes that I am a unique and incredibly special person. It won't matter that I won't be remembered....

I know that everyone (or almost everyone) participating on this sub thinks they are better than me. I don't know why anymore than I know why people in real life don't recognize my worth. I know that none of you even give enough of a shit to tell me why you think I should kill myself, or why you think it doesn"t matter if I kill myself. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU ARE BETTER THAN ME?  Why is it that people on a fucking suicide sub have zero empathy for another human being? I'm fucking angry at all of you. I HATE YOU.

THE WORLD DOES NOT FUCKING REVOLVE AROUND YOU.

I AM JUST AS IMPORTANT AS YOU.

I think my desire for success is what is stopping me. That is what I fear. That my life will have meant nothing. I"m supposed to be the person that helps the world slide into Anarchy. But how can I change the world when everyone pretends I don't exist.

Maybe I have to give up the dream that I matter.

Maybe by ignoring me you are helping me find my destiny. Maybe I really have no place on Earth. Maybe I was meant to be ignored, so I can stop fearing going through with death. Maybe going to a support board full of selfish assholes is what will make me finally shoot myself.

I always thought shooting myself would be a horrible idea. I love guns, and they have such a horrible reputation, for no reason. But it has to be the easiest way. It is quick and peaceful, or slow and painful. There is no backing out from sucking on a shotgun.

OPbody:whats inside the head of a suicidal person. 

Ive been suisical since I was 17.
Ive tried to die 9 times and counting.
Im still trying to live.

This has taken me years to get grips on, I am suicidal 
Why?
Because of my family. Because of my friends. Because of my job,

First time I tried to die was 2.5 months after I lost my bother and bestfriend in a self-inflicted gun shot to his head. At least, that is what the the coroner said.
Suicide. By a 9 mm Beretta.
He called me before he pulled th0e trigger. That phoneccall ruined my life.
 I was almost happy when he called. I was almost having a normal life. ANd I still blmame myself for not knowing, and I used ti punish myself for it. I still do. in sorts. 
	I'd be "normal" if this hadnt happpened to me. But it did. I have to live with that phone  call, almost  16 years ago. And im still fighting it.

He was ny trigger.
 Im still imagining me dying
my first self-cut war at the age og 17, on my leg. This came after I swalloed 62 ( yes, I counted, yes I remember) sleeping pills, and woke up  disgustlingy groggy with my
foster mum inviting me for dinner and movie;  I had to go.. They cant know what Ive done was the only thing on my mind.
2nd time I was 18. I cut my wris, not deep enough to bleed to death, but deeo ebough to live with the scar.  This is the time I said fuck it to the worldd.
19 was the bad part of my lifem at this time Ive gone from a regular knife to a breadknife.  Im up to 19 scars on one arm, everyone knows what my scars are. but  they 
are to afraid to ask why. 

I wake up afraid. Afraid to be alive. Afraid to be dead. 
I wake up afraid that no one will love me, because Im me. 
I wake up. At least.

At least I wake up.

Im 32 years old. And Im a surviver of myself.  And I will keep on surviving.

Because right now, I want to die.

 Help,

OPbody:I reach out to my friends. I reach out to my family.

&#x200B;

I say "I want to kill myself." "I fantasize about dying" "I go to sleep every night hoping that I'll die" and no one is listening.

&#x200B;

I don't say it often and I don't joke about this stuff.

&#x200B;

I don't meme about it, but they respond like I am making a morbid joke or tell me "you just need to do (insert fix to current 'problem')"

&#x200B;

I've been reaching out for days. I have gone to 2 classes all week. I've barely been sleeping. I've withdrawn myself from everything.

&#x200B;

Everyone is too busy to really hear me.

&#x200B;

I tried to commit suicide in 2013, and for months before hand, I tried to reach out to my family.

&#x200B;

In April 2013, I told my mom that I was considering checking into a hospital, because I was feeling very depressed, even though nothing was wrong in my life" and she said "you aren't depressed; I have depression." I asked my sister to go to dinner with me, where I told her explicitly, "I feel like I don't want to be here anymore." and she told me "not to feel that way".

&#x200B;

Then when I was in the hospital, surrounded by doctors and interns, they ALL said "We had no idea." "She never said anything". I wanted to scream! I even brought it to their attention after I was in recovery, and they apologized.

&#x200B;

I reach out. I am reaching out.

&#x200B;

No one is hearing me.

&#x200B;

I self harmed once in December 2012, months before my attempt, and I went to the doctor and got started on antidepressants. The entire night while I was hurting myself, I told my two best friends what I was doing. A nurse that I had never met before called me brave for coming in and thanked me for seeking help.

&#x200B;

I tried to kill myself at my kitchen table in September of 2013. I spent one night in the ER, and 4 days in the psychiatric ward.

&#x200B;

I felt humiliated. I felt disconnected from the world. I felt angry. I felt nothing.

&#x200B;

I went to the group sessions and learned coping mechanisms. I was started on medications that made me feel like my brain was one misfire away from exploding.

&#x200B;

I stopped all medications in favor of counseling.

&#x200B;

I went to a counselor at least once a week until May of 2015, and learned a lot about myself and my depression.

&#x200B;

I learned how to recognize when my depression was masquerading as my true desires, after getting scarily close to a second attempt at taking my life in November 2014.

&#x200B;

I wrote letters to my friends and family, got rid of some belongings that I didn't want my family to find, and I spent hours talking to my best friend, convincing them that ending my life is what I truly wanted, because living was so painful for me every day. They finally said they understood, but asked me to wait 24 hours.

&#x200B;

I went home and I slept for the first time in days, and when I woke up I literally thought to myself "holy shit, what is wrong with my brain???"

&#x200B;

Depression isn't my friend. It is a parasite that lives in my brain.

&#x200B;

It drains me of energy and impregnates my thoughts with feelings of unworthiness.

&#x200B;

Knowing this. Having this recognition. Has helped me through so much.

&#x200B;

Until now.

&#x200B;

I am exhausted. I feel my body slowing down.

&#x200B;

My motivation is gone and I've gone from 90s to 70s in my classes.

&#x200B;

I can see it happening.

&#x200B;

I am aware that it is happening.

&#x200B;

But I feel stuck.

&#x200B;

I can't move.

&#x200B;

I don't want to.

&#x200B;

id:e8wlge8, comment author:ler256, body:Hey there, 

First thing first, it's very brave of you to reach out and post your feelings. It takes alot of guts to let people know how you really feel, so you are so strong for doing that. 

Next, know you aren't alone, both myself and many other people on the sub have been to your place and felt the same things. It's hard to find or make people understand how you feel. With regards to your family, know that they think the best of you and that's why it's so hard for them to see you need help. It's ironic for sure but sometimes the people closest to us don't want to see that we are in a bad place because they want us to always be the best version of us they can remember. 

I can see you have previously felt this way and feel your depression may/has returned to the surface. Know that isn't your fault, take strength from your previous actions, it's been 4 years since your attempt and you are still here! Because you are bigger than this, you will beat it, and while it may seem unlikely now, you will come out the other side stronger. Life doesn't get easier but we get stronger! 

My thoughts are with you 

"The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward."

id:e8wqkdx, comment author:Lord_Jenkum, body:I have depression too and I've tried to be the armchair psychologist for many friends who also have depression and that shit is hard, when you are discussing your depression just understand 9/10 times they won't have anything truly helpful to say and that's not because they don't care or don't love you it's because they aren't equipped to fully understand or have a solution. There have been many times where my best friend who I would gladly do anything for has gushed his heart out about his depression and I just didn't know how to respond, I felt so helpless I broke down and cried in front of him.

I can't stress this enough thank you for reaching out I'm very happy to see that you recognize you need help please continue to seek help from professionals and others who have depression but understand it. It can be neigh impossible for some people to properly understand the problem and even people who have depression can have difficulty offering advice. Please stay safe,
 I and others want you to be ok.

OPbody:I'm about to be homeless. I'm terrified. I've been terrified and frantically trying to do anything I can to secure some kind of future, even for just a year but everything keeps falling through. The terror is driving me insane, I just can't cope. I've tried all the government organisations (I live in Australia) and the welfare I get is not enough to pay for rent and bills. Not even close. I struggle a huge amount to hold down a job, I just can't seem to cope with the stress. I've been in a psych ward and they didn't help me. No one can refer me to a place that will help me find a place to live. 

I'm mostly just paralysed from the terror, and I can't cope with it anymore. I've tried to end my life before but I fucked up - this time might be different. I've been in this state of terror and stress for so long that I can feel myself shutting down.  I need help but there isn't any. I can't take this anymore.

OPbody:So life at the moment I can't really control. I live where I live and am stuck in a lease, I am trying to apply to different jobs but have a stable one for now, and the guy I'm dating is cool but it's not incredible.

Am I the only one that doesn't want to die necessarily, but I like the idea that someday I'll be completely unconscious and not have to worry about anything? I've been suicidal in the past, not really these days but maybe I'm dealing with the aftermath of breaking up with someone who was horrible. Maybe I just have so much crap going on that I can't control that even though I don't slow down, I hang out with friends as much as possible and I consider I have the most control over my happiness and independence than I've ever had (unironically) why do I still like the idea of my brain completely turning off?

Like one of those pool meditation pods sounds amazing. The idea that when you die it's just darkness and quiet, and that sounds incredible. I've only smoked weed but I'm not into hallucinogens cause life is crazy enough as it is.


But death almost seems comforting. I don't want to die because I still have shit to do, but is there a way to just turn off your brain entirely and be removed from your body? Music connects me to my body and makes me feel alive, but I want to feel... Removed maybe? Just so I can have a break from everything, even if just for a moment.

OPbody:i have no clue who to turn to. my Parents ignore me, and when they are talking to me they are putting me down and insulting me. My brother has anger issues and takes it out on me a lot. today he hit me so had my lip swelled up to the size of a bloody golf ball and all my dad had to say about it was "well what do you want me to do about it?" my mom constantly tells me how much she hates living with us and that she wants to leave and never talk to us again. When i was a kid my parents were never around, which forced me to have to step as a parental figure to my siblings. i shouldn't complain, i know that. i love my parents, i really do and i know they provide a place for me to live but sometimes i just want to get away from them. I just think it annoys me because they don't treat my siblings the way they treat me. I know this isn't really a reason to be complaining. a lot of people are in much worse situations. I suppose I just have a weaker character. I'm sensitive.

 I can't handle quite as much as others I guess. I know its kind of dramatic, and I don't have grounds to be saying this. but ever since I was a little girl I always believed I was supposed to die before age 20. I honestly believe I am one of those people who isn't going to make it. whether that be by a car accident or by my own hand I don't know. I kind of want a freak accident to happen so I don't have to be the one to end it.

 I've always had issues with suicide. nobody knows this though. I thought about killing myself a lot from ages 10-13 or so, and then I started getting better. but for the past year or so. I have been wanting to just end it. I thought I had a clear way out. my doctor prescribed me antidepressants, and I was secretly pleased because I had found an easier way to end my life. upon recent discovery, I found out you can't overdose on Zoloft so that's unfortunate. I had planned to take all my pills by the end of this year, I guess there would be really no point now. 

I wouldn't say I want to kill myself because I hate myself. I'm just tired. Death seems like it would be so calming. I need to escape but I don't know how. I'm not scared to kill myself, I think I'm just scared to hurt those around me. I do know that there are people around me who care about me and love me. but sometimes I just don't care and want to end it. I know I could just write off my parents when I move out, but I don't really want to do that because they're still my parents and they don't deserve that, no matter what they do to me. I'm still their child. 
id:e8yjthv, comment author:xSals, body:I’m so sorry that this is happening to you. You don’t deserve to be treated like that at all. You seem like such a sweet, kind young woman.

But please, get out of there ASAP. Nobody deserves to be treated like this. If you’re under the age of 18, try and find a CPS location with a counselor that can help you get out. None of what you’ve said is your fault. The kind of things that are happening to you are not healthy and might cause you to have a harmful life. I just wanted to say from the position of somebody that also dealt with suicidal ideation that there’s another side. And you deserve to be on that other side. Please, find help and stay alive.

OPbody:I've been in a relationship for almost 2 years now. She's 25 and I'm 29 (Also have rapid cycling Bipolar type 2).

Before we started dating, I was intentionally single for over 6 years because I couldn't trust anyone enough to let them close to me. This is because every relationship I had before abstaining ended with me being cheated on.

I felt like I had met someone I could finally trust again. But my fears still controlled me. At first it was small things, like one time she told me she was going to the casino with some friends. But I got off of work to find her alone with a guy in our studio apartment. Then a week later I found a brand of condom I don't buy under the dresser.

A few weeks ago, during one of our pool league nights, I looked up from the game I was shooting to see her sitting with a random guy at our table looking very pleased with herself. I looked down and the guy had his hand on her thigh. Apparently, he had just been giving her a back rub too. She can't comprehend why I got upset about it since it was "only a back rub".

Most recently, she was supposedly in a play for her college. But it wasn't for any class. It was an extracurricular thing she was doing, but it took up hours every night. Nothing about this seemed odd until the play was suddenly cancelled a week before production. This made me question if the play even existed in the first place or what.

Even last night I tried to shake off my episodic depression by going to shoot pool for our league night. I look around the bar, and my girlfriend had just vanished. She comes back 45 minutes later saying she went with her friend to the store. But she didn't come back with anything, and she walked in alone. I almost lost it right there so I drove home.

I've been straightforward with her about my past relationships and my fears that I have as a result. I told her that I can't stop trying to get a complete picture of what's happening in my life. She makes no effort to be aware of how her actions effect my mental state. Now, because I'm extremely upset that she is engaging in very suspicious behavior (she hasn't even been home in 3 days) she is using my being upset as a reason for why she behaved the way she did before she upset me.

I'm at my wits end and I haven't even considered suicide in years. I think she just broke up with me, but I don't know for sure. What I know for a fact is I spent all my money on us, and now it feels like she's throwing me aside since I don't have my unemployment coming in anymore. I'm waiting to hear back from several job interviews but I can't see how I can afford to live without the 2nd income.

To get right down to it, I don't think I can keep living. I can't trust anyone. I have no more friends. The only family that I have close is my sister, and even then we aren't that close. I've never been able to earn more than it takes to live, and I can't do it alone again.

Honestly, I don't even feel like I'm in a depressed or manic state currently. I just can't see any other option or path to happiness.

I have no idea how anyone can help me here, I guess I'm just looking for someone to show me a path I can't see.

OPbody:I’ve been depressed for almost 2 years now. I fucking hate life it sucks so much. I lost my older brother over a year ago and it hurt so bad. Just recently my uncle passed away. It just feels like all this bad stuff keeps happening around me. I’m in love with this girl and I just can’t seem to find a way to tell her. I can’t tell for the life of me how she feels and I want to know so bad, but I’m just too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. In the back of my head I kind of know she doesn’t like me, and it just feels awful. I’ve literally never felt this way about someone and all I want is for her to feel that way about me too. I feel like all my friends don’t actually like. I feel like they’re just kind of stuck with me cuz we’re on the same sports team. But if I left the team would they still be my friends. I want to end my life so badly, but I’m just too scared to hurt everyone else in my life. There’s still a very small part of me thinks, hopes, clings to the idea that they do care about me and that they would miss me if I left. It’s just so hard to keep these positive thoughts in my head when there’s so many negative thoughts going through my mind. I’m tired of acting like everything’s fine in front of other people, I’m tired of lying to people and telling them I feel great, most importantly though, I’m tired of telling myself, lying to myself that everything is gonna be ok. It’s not, it never will be, not as long as I live.

As for being a piece of garbage, I'm 100% sure that isn't true. For a start, you found your way to Reddit and we all know no one on Reddit is a piece of garbage ;) But seriously, this is a great place to find friends and people with the same interests.

As for your cat im really sorry for your loss, give it a bit of time to mourn and eventually when you feel less gutted about your cat consider getting a new pet to help fill that lonely void. Feeling like garbage is something i go through myself (especially lately), my solution over the years has been to try to distract myself from my own negative feelings by watching tv shows,playing video games,web browsing etc. Hobbies can help but bear in mind they only temporarily take you away from your problems.

&#x200B;

Also if by any chance you are gay or a minority in any way i recommend you avoid internet comment sections on websites like youtube as sometimes the nastiness anonymous people spew can really hurt when feeling already low.

OPbody:I mean supportive to EVERYONE, not just a select few?

And yes, I know you are all thinking that no one anywhere would show support to me. I know you all think I'm unimportant, and not special in anyway. Why would anyone support me? I'm boring. 

I guess I answered my own question. No one anywhere can stand me. And everyone here thinks they are better than me.


Do you think it is hard to kill someone when you choke them during sex?

I hope it is easy cause I want this guy to kill me tomorrow. 

I met him on grindr like a year ago. He was really rough, and I went home bruised with bite marks. And I love that because we all know I deserve to be hurt, and it's hard to hurt myself. I like when other people do it for me. That's why I post at this sub. I know I'll be ignored, and then I can feel horrible about who I am. 

Anyway, he asked me if he could choke me next time we fucked. I said yes. I didn't mean it. I just assumed I would never answer his texts. He texts every few months to see if I want to fuck. I always have an excuse not to. But something has been keeping me from completely ignoring him. Now I know what it is. Maybe he can get a little too rough when he chokes me. Maybe if I'm lucky he will accidentally kill me. 

He was so rough that I started crying last time,  and he got off on that. I think he thought I did, too. And he was right. It was painful, but I needed it. I needed to feel like I wasn't important. I needed to feel like tears don't stop cruelty.

This sounds like a “13 reasons why” type scenario - committing the act and letting others know they’re to blame.  I didn’t like the show because I worried some would use it as revenge suicide. Not that I think that’s what happened with you. 

I doubt that he really thought it was your fault. When people are at the state needed to go through with suicide, they sometimes have distorted thoughts about everything, particularly if depressed. It’s like having a small fight and telling someone something cruel in the moment that you wouldn’t normally say or even think, but grossly magnified.

I think a better goal is to feel at peace with yourself. That means accepting who you are (a human being) and then being okay with where you're at in life. 

I just finished an overnight shift of work. Now I'm going to spend sometime with my family. Every moment of work and every moment of taking care of my little kids isn't joyful, but I feel peace because I want to provide for and take care of my family even though it can be hard and not always enjoyable.

However the more I think about it, the less it helps my stress go away. Like when you develop drug tolerance. Which makes me think I actually need to commit suicide soon so my only relieve in life doesn't go away.

OPbody:Not sure why I'm posting but I'm conflicted about it all. Lately I've been contemplating committing suicide and I really want to do it tonight. I've been dealing with a lot lately with my ex girlfriend, my ailing family members, the loss of my job, and the death of my grandma. I'm not satisfied with where I'm at at life and no matter what I do or what mask I wear, nothing seems to change. I'm so tired of being here. I don't want to exist any longer but I feel selfish because I have a little brother who I know will suffer if I'm gone. But I just can't, I want to be selfish, I want a catharsis from all of this pain that I'm feeling emotionally. It really hurts and I can't come to terms with anything. I've tried drugs, therapy, alcohol, etc. Nothing seems to fill the void and I'm really struggling. I'm scared but I also don't want to be here.

OPbody:This is a throwaway account.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 9 months now. He’s told me all of his problems, every issue he’s had with his exes and his family (specifically his twin brother). I’ve been nothing but supportive, not once have I ever gotten upset about him needing to vent because I know he can’t go to many other people about it.

Recently, things have gotten pretty bad. He loaned $350 to his twin, and another $700 to one of his friends who claimed she needed help financially after being in a rough spot, within days of each other. My boyfriend has a heart of gold and helped them both, without question, on the condition that they would both pay him back within a reasonable time.

Well, that kind of failed. His brother has been pushing back on paying him for weeks now, always saying he’ll get the money within the next week and then pushing it off again. And his friend has suddenly decided she hates him, wants nothing to do with him, and blocked him from any contact with her so he can’t get the money back from her either.

On top of everything else, he got denied for a career he was extremely interested in (corrections officer). The rest of his family is in shambles, to put it lightly. He fears he’s getting old, is suddenly running out of time and is panicking about what to do about anything with his life

He’s consistently saying he wants to die. He wants to buy a gun, load it with two bullets tops, and shoot himself. Or the alternative, he wants to crash his car on the highway by our house. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified to lose him. Should I call someone? I know I can’t force him to go to a hospital, and even if he was willing it’s hard because he doesn’t have health insurance to pay for it. How do I help him? 
id:e8xyx50, comment author:IfYouHaveGhosts824, body:First of all, I'm sorry for what you and your boyfriend are going through. When you're dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, it's easy to think you're alone and that the world's out to get you. You're an amazing partner for sticking by his side, and for being there for him in such a difficult time.

Don't just tell him you're there for him – show him you're there for him. Listen to him when he's had a rough day. Be his shoulder to cry on, if he needs it. Check up on him every once a while, and ask how his day's going. Surprise him with lunch or take him to do something fun occasionally. It might not sound like much, but it'll remind him he's not alone. It'll remind him he has somebody who's rooting for him and wants him to succeed. The less alone you can make him feel, the better.

If he can't be a corrections officer for whatever reason, you can help him by looking for other jobs within the same field. This could be another position in corrections or law enforcement, that he could use his degree for. Ask him what he likes about corrections, and what draws him to it, and see if you can apply that to another job. Do some research together and see what you can come up with. 

It sounds like his problems are more job-oriented and money-oriented than anything else. But the thing is, jobs come and go. Money comes and goes. Stress comes and goes...All the problems and setbacks of life are only temporary. What truly matters in life are the people around him, and the love they have for him. This means you, and everybody else in his life. Don't ever give up on him, since the love you have for each other will be the thing that endures beyond anything else, beyond any job or money troubles. Whenever the rest of the world tries to tell him he can't do something, encourage him to do it, and to do his best. Whenever somebody tries to push him down, bring him back up again. 

The only time you should ever get a third-party involved is if you feel like he's a genuine threat to himself or somebody else. Meaning if he admits he's going to hurt himself or somebody else, call 9-1-1 immediately. In this circumstance, a third-party is necessary to intervene and put him in a safe place where he's not a danger to himself or anybody else. He may be angry at first, but this could be the thing that saves his life and gives him an opportunity to start over. 

However, if he's NOT a genuine threat to himself or somebody else, putting him in a hospital can cost thousands of dollars, which will only make him more depressed. Plus, he may feel like he can't trust you or confide in you anymore, which would be a detriment since right now, he needs all the love and support he can get. 

I wish the two of you all the best in the days ahead! , ups:2, downs:0, parent:9tnzfv
id:e8xshxq, comment author:ScaryOnTheComputer, body:Tell your boyfriend to calm down a little. $1050 is nothing.

OPbody:It was a dream I had had before, a long time ago, but it played out different. I don't remember what lead to this so long story short, I had taken a gun off a table and I was ready to shoot myself. I knew it was a dream, I even said it to my family who was there in the dream. I had the gun in my mouth. I think my mom said something in the dream to me then, I don't remember what. And then I got the feeling that it wasn't a dream, like I had just woken up. Still dreaming though. I still had the gun in my mouth. I was ready. But I couldn't do it. I was afraid. I don't know what stopped me, maybe the thought of my family being devastated. But I feel disappointed that I didn't do it, so maybe in the future it would be easier to do it.

OPbody:I'm 48M, and statistically speaking, I have almost zero chance of living to age 60.  Will very likely die around age 55.  Men like me drop like flies in their 50s.

But I can't hold on that long.  It's too much.  I'm exhausted.  I've been pulling this heavy plow for too long.  I need to drop my pack and rest.  It's been a very, very long forced road march.  Just like a hump in the Marines, except it never ends.  Decades upon decades of loneliness, despair, anxiety, feeling out of place, trapped in a world where I don't understand how love works or how people work or how I'm supposed to work.

I experimented with a belt tonight.  I think I have it figured out.  Get something between the belt and the blood supply.  Cut off the blood flow instead of oxygen, and it isn't very painful at all.  I did it until I almost blacked out as a dry run, and it wasn't that bad.

I'll do it for real very soon.  Dying is easy, living is too hard.

OPbody:Sunday i was feeling monumentally overwhelmed. In the past week i tried like three times. Saturday night i was hearing voices. So sunday walked to the hospital and told them how i felt. Been here since sunday. My roommaye visited me and doesnt know how i feel. I just told her i felt overwhelmed. The thoughts still bother me each day. They are medicating me. My job is working with me for a leave of abscense. Im on my consecutive 5150 hold. My mom wants me to get closer to God. My other family somewhat knows. Im just at a loss. I read the bible today and i feel like you have to endure all hells of hells and be a good person. Then i read how they see death in the bible and it seems like you fall asleep until ressurection. I can barely deal with 2018, how am i suppose to champion through it for sixty more years?? Im loosing my mind. I know for sure something is extremely off about me. Everyday im reminded of the past mistakes. I mean grave mistakes. And it seems like i cant even process nor do i have a inner will to grind through the muck. I am faint hearted when it comes to life. Hate to sound like a punk or a b but life is so scary. I dread the fact that i tried to live in fantasy for many years. Now im seeing all my issues and it is beyond appaling. Any given moment my thoughts can become loud. When they do thats what triggers everything. Im truly in limbo. Stay alive and feel overwhelmed or be dead and be asleep forever. And i listened to some people on youtube and it seems like fantasy. One lady said that we can do no wrong and thers is no sin. This other guy said the same thing. But i know thats a lie. I have a wandering eye and i dont stay on one thing. My mind replays the loop of it all. Im sorry for everyones pains and struggles.

OPbody:I'm a non native english speaker but I think my english is alright , Just do not mind of the few mistakes I might do please.   
 

Basicly I've always had bonding / social problems because I never felt any connection with anyone , But learned over the years how to "fake" socialisation , I've seen a lot of therapist and child psychiatrists about the anxiety / stress problems I was going through which they never understood the true cause since from an exterior point of view I was fairly normal , As time passed I got to highschool , First week I only cried second week I did three vasovagal pass out due to pain that comes with stress /anxiety (Since I cannot do panic attacks due to how I control my emotions so this is what happens instead, Had those since I was 6 but I always had atleast three months between each one those were three in three days) I then did a burnout , Stopped going to school , still seeing a child psychiatrist I was 15 at the time , a year passed we found nothing and I was feeling very guilty of everything that was happening because she was basicly saying I was inventing my problems And I wasn't willing of doing anything that she told me to do since I just didn't have the energy for it which made her mad most of the time  
After that we found a mental clinic close by and since my mom is invalid we are 100 % covered in medical costs so I could go there which I did First time I went two weeks full time They kinda had the same idea as my child psychiatrist so I went on the internet and did a lot of research like A lot of it And since I had a depersonalisation problem I was kinda objective on myself I found that I was probably Schizoid Went back to the clinic for two weeks told my psychiatrist (for adult this time) everything I knew about it and how I linked myself to it she told me she'll program an orchard test for me even tho they weren't orienting themselves toward that Two months later I took it (two weeks ago) I'm 17 , got the results from the therapist that made me pass it And told me basicly everything I needed to hear to feel understood I cried a lot that day I felt like after 11 years I was finnally partly understood And that my "self diagnosis" was probably right tho we needed more info for that So everything should be fine right? Well now that I know all that I'm questioning If I really want to live this life where I cannot truly experience any feelings or do any true bond So Yeah I really question myself do I really want to live or not.  
I know that's a lot of lecture but I'd really like anyone view on this

OPbody:I’m just so fucking alone and I don’t know what to do. All I want is to spend time with someone, talk to someone, feel like I matter to someone. That’s it. I’ve tried talking to friends and being like “hey I’m struggling” and all they respond with is “you’re great” and then silence. I’ve tried telling my mom that I’m struggling and she just makes the conversation about herself and then tells me she has to go five minutes later. I tried the crisis text line and they just had a five minute exchange before sending me a link and ending the conversation without even seeing if I was feeling a little better. I called the suicide hotline a little while ago and my phone counselor was kind but had to end the conversation after fifteen minutes. 

I am thinking a lot about killing myself. The only thing immediately stopping me is that I don’t want my roommates to have to deal with getting rid of all my stuff and I don’t want to traumatize whoever it is that happens to find my body. 

I don’t really want to check in to a hospital because all that has done in the past is left me more anxious with bills I couldn’t pay and antipsychotic medications I don’t need (I’ve never had psychotic symptoms and have never been manic). 

It just feels like no matter what I say or who I say it to they either don’t recognize just how bad I feel or don’t care enough to talk for more then five minutes. I honestly don’t think it would impact anyone very much if I died tomorrow.

And the fact is,  sometimes it just doesn't get better.  Sometimes it doesn't get easier. 

Sometimes you're literally just wired wrong.  

Sometimes the best you can hope for is a hollow existence, relying on a practiced state of disassociation to get you through the day.  

Which isn't exactly all that fulfilling.  

Suicide is largely stigmatized because we live in a society shaped by religion and government. Institutions designed to take control away from people by casting personal choice in a negative light.  

They propagate those ideas to maintain control.  We're cogs in their machine.  Infinitely replaceable worker bees, but having ten is still better than having nine. Right?  

The fact is,  whether anyone else agrees with you at any point, you are completely in control of your person.  

And in the end suicide, like anything,  is only what you believe it to be.

id:e8ww9km, comment author:philosophunc, body:Yeah I totally get it. What's real is real and older opinions dont minimize your emotion. All I can say is at that age alot of shit is happening in EVERYONES life. It's common for people to be self absorbed, volatile and fickle. It's not your fault everyones still very excitedly experimenting with friendship groups, themselves, drugs, alcohol etc. Many go crazy in the experience and feel a little empty a little later. Just be genuine with people and yourself and meet more people. I know people in their 40s with superficial friendships. Dont sweat it. Do you have very good friends from a  long time ago ?

 If I had one regret from that age it would be having wasted time on certain people and not gotten out and made some more friends from scratch, broadening my circle into people and interests I wouldn't expect I'd enjoy.

 No matter what you'll end up meeting some superficial people and friends. You know friends that are about getting along with a clique. We all know those people who are about the group or circle. They go along with the mass with relatively vapid individual friendships with each person. In truth I was kind of like that because I was lazy. And I'd ask myself is there more? Ultimately I was lucky and I have some very true friends stick by me even after I've moved abroad for 8 years. 

Even this experience you're having know is a form of questioning that is part of growing up. Maybe you're feeling this way because you're realizing hey this isnt it? Theres more, you cant quite put your finger on it yet but you know theres more substance somewhere in people, in interests, in your life and theirs. Maybe they're just developing at a different rate. Or maybe you have shit friends. You never really know. All life is a learning experience. So you are feeling an inadequacy somewhere.... in your relationships? In being liked? Perhaps itll pave way to the question why should I be liked ? Why should anyone ? Why do i like people? Why do I like myself etc etc. Dont be to hard on yourself and don't be insecure. Noone ever regretted living too much and people forget about embarrassment quickly. Anyway that's just the rambling of a 31 year old. Might not mean much. But it's all I got so far. Wisdom comes with age but sometimes age comes alone. , ups:2, downs:0, parent:e8wncv3

OPbody:...Insane… as in, being unable to tell the difference between reality and imagination/delusion?

That certainly not, unless you're a 
schizophrenic

**Or** insane as in…. depressed, shit doesn’t make sense and I feel empty inside?

Anyway, do what you like. Kill yourself, don’t kill yourself, in the end it’s just death. Who cares after what happens after you die anyway? Am I right? probably just nothingness, darkness. You won’t exist, you won’t be seeing darkness, you won’t know darkness, you simply wouldn’t be able to know anything. Because you no longer are real.

Understand? Good. Suicide isn’t really about the person who committed it, but the people who knew them. They live on, remembering someone who no longer draws breath, while you remember nothing.

You’ll become nothing, can you come to terms with that?

Life’s painful, I get it. When you die you won’t feel anything at all. Because you won’t have any nerves that make up your body that make you able to feel. You won’t be able to think or register anything, you won’t be able to move around or do jack shit. You’ve literally become nothing. Your flesh has probably been eaten by insects, or you’ve become ash.

Next time you see ash, just think, that could be you some day.

Next time you see dirt, give it a good ol’ kick won’t you? Because dirt doesn’t have a mind, it doesn’t feel, it doesn’t know that it is dirt, it doesn’t know anything, it isn’t aware of anything. That could be you one day.

So tell me, whats worse, ‘insanity?’ or non-existence?
id:e8xoij6, comment author:ScaryOnTheComputer, body:Insanity, but it can easily be fixed. I'm schizoaffective meaning I'm not quite schizophrenic but I have the traits of one. I've spent time in wards and trust me insane can be pretty bad. I remember talking to a lobotomy patient and it was like talking to a robot that doesn't want to talk to you. There are worse things in life than death, and insanity is one of them. But again, you can fix it. You can fix anything in your life just so long as you choose to. If you choose not to you'll just keep digging a hole deeper and deeper until you hit rock bottom. So don't feel so bad about living. It could always be worse., ups:2, downs:0, parent:9tnmcm
id:e8xsle9, comment author:Justwaitingforever, body:I've always seen suicide as a completely neutral action. Not good, not bad. You can't blame someone for doing it, but on the other hand you can't consider it a "right" course of action. , ups:2, downs:0, parent:9tnmcm
id:e8xowl5, comment author:InterneuronalMeadows, body:There's honestly, objectively, no reason for one to not commit suicide. You can keep on living and feeling the weight and pain of your life on your back, fighting for stimuli and pleasure and eventually succumb to your age. Or, you can just kill yourself and become nothing. With no prejudice about your actions or empathy for those you leave behind. Because your universe dies with you. 

So, the choices are:

**a)** Suffer and die

**b)** Die

What do you prefer?

id:e8xqib2, comment author:ScaryOnTheComputer, body:Suffering is inevitable, but that's the price you pay for being happy. Everything comes to an end like I said, including suffering and happiness. One day you'll meet somebody who won't take your suffering away, they'll just make you contempt with it. Then, eventually you won't even think about how sad you are. You'll be too busy being happy. Then once that happiness ends, you'll suffer for a while. Life is like a rollercoaster of emotions, you go up, then down, then up, then down. Sometimes, you only go up. Sometimes you only go down. But either way if you end it you won't ever go up. You'll be at the bottom of the rollercoaster and boom. Your life is over.

You can also choose to live and fight. But when you reach your peak it's time to die. Whenever you possess the power to fight, you **fight**. When you lose the power to fight it's time to die. I haven't reached my peak yet but it's only a matter of time, I think., ups:2, downs:0, parent:e8xqib2

Hey person, I heard about what happened and I'm sorry for how that all went down, i understand how it can feel where everyone sends messages like sorry for your loss and stuff, and how the family tends to gossip a bit and how they may not understand how you are  truly feeling. I want you to know that I am here for you confidentially and no judgements if you ever want to talk about anything. I mean it. Talking about the face under the mask is hard but I'm here for you. Just know you don't have to go through this alone. Just consider it.
Its broad and sincere and not a sorry for your loss like everyone else is sending her. I dont want to push her into it but to know her options are open and that we can talk about anything.

My gf is about to leave me because I have low self esteem and when I job hunt I tell my self people don’t like me, that’ I’m a fuck up, that I don’t deserve anything. I have so much anger and rage in from my poor relationship with my parents and spending two years in bording school to going to jail for close to a year when I got caught with shrooms. I don’t know how to talk to people well and just don’t see the point anymore.

OPbody:I'm so anxious and depressed that I don't work, I don't go to school, and I am deeply terrified of doing anything to change that. My parents have been supporting me, but that'll only last for so long. I've been hoping for so long that someone would suddenly come out of nowhere, willing to help me and support me and love me. But now I realize that that won't happen. No one will love me. All that I have to look forward to is more loneliness, and eventually, unbearable levels of anxiety and torment. I don't know when it will be-- if my parents will get sick of me and kick me out or if they will die or get too old and I'll have to leave or get a job or something.... but I know that it will happen. Someday. And I know that if that happens and I'm still the way I am now, I will have no choice but to kill myself.

trying to get better is pointless.  living is pointless.  if i'm in this much pain, if i'm this miserable every second of my life, shouldn't i just end it?  why keep torturing myself like this?  at this point, killing myself is the rational choice.  so that's what i'll do.

My wife and I are going to therapy, I'm being required to attend an sex offender program and I'll probably never work again as I doubt I'll clear a employment background check, which places all the financial burden on my wife. I've been relegated to a house hubby homemaker.

I wish I had other people aside from my therapist (great as she is) to talk to about this (as in talk, in person), as having all these thoughts and the angst circling around in my head, with only an hour a week to let it out, isn't it chief.

OPbody:A couple of months ago, I said "if nothing's improved by my birthday I'll kill myself". Well, a friend managed to convince me to keep going. I survived my birthday.

Since then, I've started seeing a psychologist. I've gone through another 2-3 antidepressants with no improvement. 

I've made a serious effort to find SOMETHING worth living for. I've even managed to make a couple of new friends. 

But it all just feels pointless. I don't feel any better. Really, if anything, putting in all that effort trying to find a reason to live has just left me even more convinced life isn't for me. 

I wish that friend hadn't messaged me. That I'd just been allowed to give up. To die. Because trying to find a reason not to just left me even more hurt. 

It just feels selfish. They kept me from ending my suffering, because THEY don't want me to die. Like that's somehow worth me suffering through the hell that is my existence.

Right now, all I can think is, I just want it all to STOP. Just. Fucking. STOP. And today is arguably the best day I've had in... forever. 

I think the next time I have a bad day, I'm gonna end up cutting my wrists open. Just bleed out. I'm done trying to live just because others want me to. I don't care any more. I'm gonna do what's best for me, and make the pain go away...

OPbody:When I’m depressed and look at cutesy, happy, excited characters on stuff like cereal boxes, I have this weird emotion. It’s not quite anger, not quite sadness, not quite resentment or jealously. It’s just this weird feeling that roughly makes me think “what the fuck are you so happy about” but still nothing that clear cut. It then amplifies my depression for no apparent reason. The funny thing is that the cheesier/tackier the character is, the more annoying it is too.

OPbody:I feel like I have disappointed both my parents. I am someone who gets B's and C's. And I am a smart aleck who talks back to my parents when they are yelling at me for not doing what they are telling me to do. I don't know if I love them or not because of all the mistakes that have happened. I do not know if I respect them. They say they love me but I'm sure that's a lie. I have disappointed both my parents by not listening to them. Now that I'm 18 I can't be reshaped with new, good morals. I lie a lot. I have considered suicide maybe once or twice. I have been to the mental hospital once for holding knitting needles to my mother's neck out of pure anger. I don't deserve them at all. My mother is ignoring me because I don't have any respect for her. I deserve to die. However, I can't die in pain because I am a wimp and I do not want to feel pain. I can't do anything right that would make them happy. My dad has asked me if I want to drop out, and I have wanted to say yes, but then that would make my parents even sadder because of how much of a failure I am. If I died, I'm sure my parents would finally be free of the misery that I cause.

The fact that you’re worried that you’re parents don’t love you shows that you still love them, and care about what they think about you to some extent.

OPbody:My brother has been having relationship issues for a while now. He is 22 his girlfriend/fiance is also 22 with a 7 year old child to another man. 

Their relationship hasn't been going too well recently, i think they may be in a bit of a rut. They haven't been speaking to each other properly, when he says i love you to her she doesnt say it back.

He has called my mum tonight balling his eyes out, telling her all of these things. Thinking his girlfriend is going to get rid of him tonight. He is saying his life is shit and he should just kill himself and he has been feeling this way for quite some time.

He is having a talk with his girlfriend today, my mum has told him to leave nothing unsaid. Explain how he is feeling, his issues with the relationship and then go from there.

Im just really scared i might lose my litte brother. 

I really hope that it is all just a flood of overwhelming emotions at the moment and in time he will calm down.

He did text me earlier today saying they were having problems, and i just replied that i hope they can work it out and im here for him if he needs anything.

I've text him again saying i love him and it doesnt matter what happens tonight ill be there with what ever he needs.

Im just not sure what else i should be doing?
id:e8xzqpg, comment author:IfYouHaveGhosts824, body:First of all, I'm sorry for what you and your brother are going through. When you're dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, it's easy to think you're alone and that the world's out to get you. You're an amazing brother for sticking by his side, and for being there in the roughest of times.

Honestly, you're doing more than enough for him without even realizing it. When I was depressed, there are so many times I wish somebody would've checked on me, just to see how I was doing. 

But in the end, don't just tell him you're there for him – show him you're there for him. Listen to him when he's had a rough day. Be his shoulder to cry on, if he needs it. Check up on him every once a while, and ask how his day's going. Surprise him with lunch or take him to do something fun occasionally. It might not sound like much, but it'll remind him he's not alone. It'll remind him he has somebody who's rooting for him and wants him to succeed. The less alone you can make him feel, the better.

If I'm being brutally honest, his issues are something he's going to have to come to terms with on his own. You can't force him to overcome his depression, since you can't force him to feel a certain way. But you can still help him through the darkness and show him the light. Whenever the rest of the world tries to bring him down, bring him back up again. When somebody tells him he can't do something, encourage him to do it, and to do his best. Remind him how much your whole family loves him and cares about him. Remind him you would much rather help him with his problems than have to bury him. Remind him there's still a whole world out there, just waiting for him, and he still has so much left to do and accomplish – especially at such a young age. 

I wish you and your brother all the best in the days ahead! , ups:1, downs:0, parent:9tnshv

The only person I’ve ever cared about even a little, the girl I have a crush on, Sylvia, always ignores me and she still wants me to just go away. Her body language tells me she wishes she didnt have to deal with me being around. So that’s it. I’m all done here. I don’t know if it’s gonna be tonight or tommorrow night but the city I live in is a pretty small island, so there’s a pretty big bridge connecting us to the mainland.

OPbody:For starters I am an 18 year old bisexual male. I posted here a month ago (and deleted it) going to kill myself. It didn’t work out because my roommate was awake, and also my other friend called security on me so everyone there knew I was messed up and I just had to go to bed. I freaked out and dropped out because I couldn’t deal with people knowing things about me.

It’s been a month and nothing is close to better. I  need routine to function but I don’t have one. My family is making me pay rent in my childhood house because I dropped out. My acne is the worst it’s ever been and my face and back look like a minefield. I’m losing weight even though I’ve been underweight my whole life. I Let myself get fucked by another man while I was really drunk and he wasn’t and I regret it so much and hate myself. I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself. I wish I was normal. 

I’m too scared to talk to anybody. My mom said if I kill myself it’d just be inconvenient for her and her business. Nobody really cares...

I’ve failed before and I’m not going to fail again. If this is the only thing I get to succeed at so be it. Thank you

I am worried about my parents and my brother now. But I feel like I can't live for other people.
id:e8y5xpy, comment author:EverythingIsGone100, body:He’ll still miss you. It’s just hard for some to ever understand suicide. They get frustrated and annoyed. I’m lucky in that my fiancé said he would understand if I did it, but he admitted that it would destroy his life. 

Almost everyone lives for someone else. Think about how many people have terrible lives. They eat, sleep, work at a job they may hate, eat, and sleep again. Hobbies help, but it’s hard to live on hobbies alone, so they seek human contact. Then they form bonds so that it’s hard to leave those people. 

I live mainly for my family and cat. My cat cries when I’m away, and I don’t want my final thoughts to be imagines of my mom, cat, and fiancé crying. 

You can live for others too. It’s not easy, but neither is suicide. Neither is living easy for most if they truly think about all the misery and tedium in their lives. I’ve sometimes wondered why there aren’t more suicides and I think it’s due to not wanting to hurt others. Please note I’m not trying to make you feel bad or selfish, just commenting on humanity. I would quickly commit suicide if I knew no one would care, so I’m in no position to judge anyone., ups:2, downs:0, parent:9tpdac

Like human beings are such a pathetic specie that one minute your alive the next your dead from self inflicted injuries. Well here is the thing just because I feel it doesn't mean I have to be it. I sometimes feel like crap, but I am not crap. I feel lonely most of the time and alone in the world but I realize the world doesn't owe me anything, it doesn't owe me happiness or companionship or love.

I struggle with these thoughts for a long time and I don't understand why suicide seems such a final option to me while those around me do have depressive episodes but suicide is still abstract to them.

I have a long history of mental health issues (stalking/abusive dad, ED, foster home etc) and I feel like due to long hospitalization I screw up my education and thetefor I fail to be proud of what I am now (social worker, special needs facility, wanted to study physics though).

OPbody:I have been on countless medications and have seeked so much help for over 15 years. My main reason for not wanting to live is that i often feel bad regardless of my life's outside circumstances. Making a lot of money? Doesn't matter. Have beautiful women in my life? Doesn't matter. Doing what i want to do when i want to do it? Doesn't matter. I believe my problems come from the inside. I have a huge history of mental illness in my family with lots of suicides. The main question for me that i feel nobody can answer is that is this worth it? Is my life going to be worth it? Will the hard work and pain be worth the good times? I believe nobody can answer that. I have no desire to have a wife or children or a care for a job. And i feel like a lot of people revolve their lives around these things.

OPbody:I had a massive fight with my mom. She seems to think it's all better because she spewed some Christian crap. 

I was supposed to have gotten on a plane with mom and dad yesterday to fly to my aunt's funeral. A panic attack and undiagnosed depression (we'll get to that in a sec) kept me from going. I've seriously damaged my relationship with my dad, and hurt my mom. Tonight I wanted to be around a friend and I was forced to come home to "grieve" since this is the day of the funeral. We argued for an hour when I got home, and I decided tonight is the time to go.

I don't know how, but I'm thinking pills, or I sneak out and drive to a bridge. My therapist is a hack, who hates diagnosis and doesn't believe I have depression. If you want some proof, check my last post, which is an email I sent him Sunday.

OPbody:Well, I am never much of a writer or a fan of creating post on reddit. I just feel that this is the appropriate place for what I have to say. I just turned 21 years old a couple months ago. Life has always been hard for me, there are times that I thought about giving up but eventually thoughts are just thoughts you know. I am always described as driven, always know my end goal and dreams. I am passionate and love what I am doing. I am currently a junior in a reputable university in United States working on my engineering degree. Good grades and everything, why should I feel sad? Since the beginning of this year, I have been operating on 80-90 hours week with working full time and going to school full time. The reason behind it is to make enough money to pay all the rent, utilities, etc... and as well as keeping on scholarship status. I had a loving girlfriend who always care for me and listen to what I have to say. You could say that my stress has been manageable. About a week and a half ago, my girlfriend walked out of the bedroom telling me that she has to do homework downstair. For some odd reasons, I felt like something was not right. Thirty minutes later, I went downstair to check and she took the car and was gone, with all the homework and school backpack at home. I ran outside like a madman, even driving my car right in front of the house and waited for her. I waited for about 3 hours until 4AM when I realized the relationship is over. She came back at 5:30AM with messy clothes and I knew exactly what she did. For the rest of that day, we spent our time together crying, again I don't know why we did that. Perhaps it was the fact that we were engaged to each other and I made plans revolving around our future family. The emotional pain and the toxicity of the situation did not hit me until the next day. I had an interview with an engineering company for a summer internship and the first question they asked me was What is your strength? It was at that moment when I managed to get 5 words out of my mouth and started crying uncontrollably. I drove an hour to her house and when I did not see her car outside at 11, I thought about what happened the day before. I don't know what my thought were at the time but I downed about 20 pills of Extra Strength Tylenol. Now if you know something about suicide, OD on non-prescription drug has about 6% of success rate. Perhaps I did it to lash out on my ex as well as a way for me to cope with the stress and trauma. I ended up rushing to the hospital where they held me for 2 days under suicide watch. I have been told to go to Student Counseling Services as well as Student Assistance Services and they have been going extra mile to help me cope with what happened. But now... a week and a half after all the drama and emotional pain, I don't think I can take it anymore. I know I have a lot of live for, part of me still wants to live because of my dreams and goal and not wanting to give up. But the other part is in extreme pain and there are times that I feel I can't continue anymore. I don't have a lot of friends and family but they all care about me. I just wish that they don't care so much so it would have been easier on my conscience to give up.

I have been suicidal since I was 15, hospitalized once, am now 21 but have still struggled all my life. Been in therapy all my life, it never helped. One suicide attempt. Recently (in the past 3 months or so) my mom has intervened and made me see a psychiatrist. It took me a while to go, but I eventually did. My doctor (pediatrician/adult family practice dr) had been managing my mental health up until this point, but I wasn’t sure if any of the meds were helping. I had tried many different ones from several different classes of drugs. I think I felt uncomfortable talking to my doctor about how I really felt and always wanted to say things were fine. However, at the new psychiatrist I decided to be completely honest. I have suffered mental/physical/sexual abuse and I just told him everything and how I was feeling. Prior to this I was just laying in bed, not working or going to school (I withdrew from college) and was just drinking myself away all day until it was time to sleep. My psychiatrist prescribed a different medication he said my doctors should’ve tried and took me off my old medication. It was a really tough transition and I had a nervous breakdown twice, but now I am completely off the other med and on the new med. Things are different now. Before I couldn’t even see color that well, it all seemed grey, and it seemed suicide was inevitable. Now I can see everything vibrantly and experience life differently. I am a totally changed person. I am happy and optimistic, I think about a happy future, I make better choices, I care about myself and life. This also gave me the courage to see a therapist and tell them everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, I didn’t hide a single thing. And I felt better after letting it all out. Now I am working on my substance abuse issues, which are definitely still there, and I still have some skeletons in the closet, but I feel like the rough patch has finally ended. I feel like I can finally be me again and figure myself out and live a normal life. And I want you all to know, I really didn’t make that many healthy changes before this medication started to work. And I just wanted to give some home to you guys that sometimes it really is medication that makes all the difference in the world. And it really is worth it to talk to a psychiatrist and tell them everything. Thanks for listening to this post, I hope it doesn’t get deleted, and thank you all for being here for me when I was at my lowest.

OPbody:I dream about death, think about death everyday. Lots of stuff from my childhood that still haunts me. My dad putting my cat down and still crying about her. I'm ordering a tombstone for her grave and put it on her grave with some flowers with permission from the new owner of the trailer park where we use to live at. Hopefully that would stop the nightmares that wake me up in the middle of the night and if it doesn't, I don't know what will.

The job I'm at right now treats me good and everything and is the only workplace I can find in the area that treats me well and they understand and tolerate the fact that I have autism. After finding out, I understand now why some people were treating me like a second class citizen. Some of you may not know much about autism but it's definitely not easy to live with. We are more prone to anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts and ideation then the general population according to statistics posted by organizations that work with people who have autism more closely.

OPbody:

I’m not really sure why, but I’ve been wanting to kill myself for a while now. The thing is, I’m not sad, or depressed, nor do I have any burdens or have sunken into some sort of horrible situation.

But the thing is, I will be. My grades in school are horrendous, and I’m a very bad student. I doubt college is even an option for me at this point. I also hate manual labor, so I can’t even do a trade school. All the things I want to do (music, writing, etc) I’m not all too dedicated to, but those are the only things I’d ever want to do as a career. And even if I do go to college, I’ll most likely be stuck in some shitty underpaying corporate job sucking cock and kissing ass all day. If I can get a job at all, that is.

Student debt will be huge, as it is for everyone in my country. And speaking of my country, I hate it. I fucking despise everything about the political and social climate we live in. I refuse to be a part of that shit. I’ve had a great life. Plenty of friends, good times, nice experiences, but I think I wanna quit while I’m ahead. Life is fine, but the world I live my life in is not. So I’ll end it. I won’t suffer for the profit of others, I won’t be a slave to a shitty, broken system. I’ll drive up to Maine with a guitar, a gun, and some food. I’ll sit on top of a mountain, and I’ll play my guitar for however long I fucking want and then shoot myself. I’ll die happy. 

I don’t want to deal with life’s bullshit. I want to die happy. I’m gonna kill myself before things get bad so I don’t have to drag myself through decades of shit before deciding to off myself. 


Convince me why this isn’t a good idea.

OPbody:I want to kill myself.


(Disclaimer: this is a wild ride. I didn’t know how to organize my thoughts. But know, currently, I am definitely leaning towards killing myself.) 


But I don’t want my boyfriend or family to feel bad or responsible...


It’s 100% not their fault and my decision. I have dug myself so deep into debt. I’ve also dug myself deep into a hole of despair...I am addicted to Ritalin, weed and alcohol. 


There is nothing anyone can do. 


What is the easiest way to let my boyfriend of five years and my older sister (who has two young children; one 4yrs and one 2yrs) a younger brother (17yrs) and mom + dad know?


I’ve wanted to die for years. But now I have a legitimate reason to actually end my life. 


I’ve fucked myself over...


I’ve already dropped out of two college programs and am now, going to drop out of a third (because I’m failing every single class by a landslide. I cannot work myself out of it...).



My boyfriend told me if I dropped out of this program he would break up with me. He said he doesn’t want to be with a loser...I am not even paraphrasing. That is word for word what he said. 


I have already dropped out of two programs. So it definitely makes sense he would want to leave me. I am definitely a loser.


I have wasted all of my college loans on liquor to get through the day. I am actively aware of what I am doing, but for some reason can’t reach reality. I feel like I have been screaming at myself from the sidelines to do better I keep yelling to myself that I’m failing and need to try harder. 


But it doesn’t register with me. 


I have no money or motivation/will left. I have been living on my own for over 1.5 years and the fact that I’m independent and alone doesn’t scare me.  It’s the finances.  


I’ve looked for a job for over a year and have heard nothing back. 


I’m in thousands of dollars of debt (like at least $20,000). That I have been hiding from everyone...My boyfriend thinks I’m in $5,000 of debt total. 


I have the option to drop out of college for a few years and work full time from my home town. However, I would need to move all of my belongings, an entire bedroom plus my pets (dog, ferret, cat and more) 200Km from where I am living now. 


My boyfriend would then need to find a new roommate to fill my room to appease our landlord. (I only bought the extra room so less people would live in the house and my pets could have a room.)



If I move home though, I would also be moving back into a toxic environment. One that I had been looking forward to leaving my whole life...My parents have been fighting for years and have slowly caused my younger brother to go insane (anger issues, can’t keep a job and money problems.).


I truly do not know what is wrong with me. 


I went into a medial program and had to drop out because it was too much for me. Then I went into an Art Program that I realized I fucking hated.  Then into an Office Administration program that I thought I would love. But am failing every class, because I physically couldn’t bring myself to go. 


It has been 2 months of my new program (office Administration) and I literally can’t make myself go to class no matter what. 


I wake up everyday day and I think to myself 
“I need to go to class today, if I don’t, I’m ruining my entire life.”


I still don’t go. I need help. I don’t know what to do?  


If I can’t figure everything out by December, I am done. I’m ending it after Christmas so then the anniversary of my death won’t ruin a major holiday...(I know it sounds angsty and extra. But I really do want to die and I want my friends and family to suffer the least.) 


So my main questions are these;


Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation that I am in?


What is the best course of action for me?


How can I end my life without making my boyfriend or immediate family overly sad??


Thank you in advance so much for reading everything I wrote. Although I’m sure no one actually would read it...


Tl;dr: I have dropped out of two programs. Entered into a new one so I could live. Can’t physically bring myself to go to class, so I’m failing. My boyfriend said he would break up with me if I dropped my current program. I will definitely not pass it. My only option is to move back into a toxic environment 200km away from where I currently am or end my life. What should I do? 



id:e8wcq0o, comment author:DonteLane, body:One thing that has always resonated and stayed with me is that relief is a human emotion, and you cant feel an emotion or feeling if you are dead. Things are hard now but that doesn't mean that it cant get better. Some people are worse off and still make it every day. Just remember that you still have years ahead of you. If things don't work out with your boyfriend maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Dont hurt your self and show your niece/nephew/family that they have an easy way out of their problems. They care about you I'm sure , ups:5, downs:0, parent:9tgxgp
id:e8wbchs, comment author:dJ_86, body:My story is much of the same, it's crazy how similar it is right down to having to move back in with narcissistic parents again. I'm out of options myself and I'll be checking back for advice in the comments. One thing I will mention is to get checked out for depression and ADHD which I suspect you have- I have both. I wish you well OP! , ups:3, downs:0, parent:9tgxgp
id:e8wfapi, comment author:THAUONTDIUEN, body:You seem to be blaming yourself for a lot but a lot of your problems appear to be the effects of depression; lack of will to do the things you want to do, feeling frozen or trapped, substance dependence, even blaming yourself - these are all symptoms of depression;
When you feel trapped in a spiral sometimes the best thing to do is to try and break out of it, even the smallest actions can help you to move forward step by step - if you feel like you cant go to class then maybe just start by getting out of your room, going for a walk, grab some coffee, find small things you can do regularly and let them build up into positive routines and habits, eventually youll get to where you want to be and youll be capable of beating those issues that seem insurmountable

Part of finding that that fresh start is to be concious of your emotional state and to reach out for help which youre already doing - so youre already on the right track - when it comes to finding help a psychiatrist who can provide medication can be immensely beneficial in giving the right neurochemical boost to aid in building those healthier and happier routines, and if thats too difficult at the moment there are always groups, hotlines, and even friends, or people on here you can talk to 

Id say from your awareness and the way you try new things youve got a strong will, I believe you can accomplish even more than you might expect

id:e8wj7y7, comment author:talipally, body:The fact that you are open to help means you still have the will to live, which is a good thing trust me. With that being said, look up almost any success story and you’ll find some common similarities with your situation. Those rags to riches stories often involve people who are not only broke, but severely in debt. People who were jobless. Homeless. Struggled with addiction.

Stephen King lived in a trailer and was flat broke but still persevered to become a writer.

JK Rowling was on welfare and was in deep poverty while she was writing Harry Potter.

Robert Downey JR struggled with severe addiction issues.

Pretty sure Oprah was flat broke too, wearing potato sacks for clothes at one point in her life. 

These types of people have also overcome such obstacles in their life to become successful. And you can too, absolutely.

You have to first start with that mentality, that you are worth your life. That you will become successful. 

20k debt? Pffft that’s nothing compared to what most people have, which is well over 50k in student loans.

Fun fact: I owe 30K in loans and guess what? I’m a college drop out too! Yup. And my boyfriend at the time also was not supportive of my decision to drop out of college to become an actress. So I dumped him. I didn’t need that kind of negativity in my life and neither do you. 

No boyfriend (or girlfriend) should ever be condescending to the ones they love. Fuck your boyfriend for calling you a loser and not being supportive. Cut his dumbass out of your life, trust me he’s only bringing you down.

Get a fresh start. Somewhere. Anywhere. A fresh start will often mean a new chapter of your life.

No money? Can you try doing uber or Lyft? How about looking on Craigslist for some gigs (with caution of course). 

Job hunting sucks, but this is one area where persistence does pay off. Broaden your job search. Apply EVERYWHERE. Everywhere. Everywhere. Even if you don’t think you’ll get the job I don’t care, apply for it anyways. Call them back after a week or two to “check the status of your application.” Show them you’re interested in the job. Most of the jobs I’ve ever gotten in my life were not just because I mass applied everywhere, but I also followed up with each job via phone call, which often led to an interview. Apple for jobs, every single day, even if it’s just one. (Check online too).

Dont be ashamed for dropping out of school. Like I said, I did it, and I’m happy I did. College isn’t for everyone. Find what you want to do and follow that, whether that involves colleges or not.

Your addiction seems to stem from being severely depressed, which is common for people. People often turn to drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes under extreme stress and depression, so nothing is “wrong” with you, you’re just behaving how a normal depressed person would. The best way imo to kick an addiction is by slowly weaning off of it. Cutting it cold turkey often leads to cravings and withdrawal symptoms as well as a high possibility of relapse but if you slowly decrease it in increments (like 1 less cigarette a day for a week than 2 less cigarettes a day etc) than you’ll have a better chance of overcoming it.

I can tell you want to get better and your situation hits close to home for me and I’m sure for many others as well. As cliche as “you’re not alone” sounds, know that many many others have been in your situation or worse and have come out just fine on the other side. You just have to tell yourself “enough is enough I want to live my life on my own terms” and start cultivating that. 

And no we’re not going down the suicide route. Everything in life is fixable. Everything. Remember that. You got this, I believe. , ups:3, downs:0, parent:9tgxgp
id:e8wb7mo, comment author:MrSmigick, body:I know 20k seems like a scary amount of debt, but it's not insurmountable. Years ago, my father got an infection in his knee out of the blue without any warning signs or obvious causes. He was uninsured at the time, and had to go the hospital for a week. The cost of just staying in the hospital bed for that time came to 36k The total debt he into was way bigger, and included the cost of surgery, medicine, and from maxing out all of his credit cards. He was just about to land his dream job making thirty five bucks an hour. His associates degree was about to pay off, but they fired him because he couldn't work anymore. He's not a middle class man, either. He overcame his medical debt while working as a baker.

I don't think suicide is your best course of action. It sounds to me like addiction is causing you a lot of problems, and could be part of why college has proven to be so difficult. Seeing an addiction psychiatrist could help with this. Does your boyfriend know you are struggling with addiction and suicidal thoughts? He's suppose to be supporting you, but he's calling you a loser? What the fuck? I could be wrong, and he could've just been angry in the heat of the moment or something, but if this sort of behavior is a regular thing he does without apology, then he sounds like a negative influence in your life.

Why do you want to go to college? If you know what it is you want to learn, you could take some time off to study before applying so the material will at least be familiar when you're in class. Khanacademy is great for that sort of thing.

id:e8wixen, comment author:HoneyBadgeSwag, body:Hey there. I just read your whole post and I am so sorry for everything that you are going through. I remember when I left college because I couldn't get it to click and it really shook my self confidence. Eventually I found out I had ADHD and another disorder that makes it impossible for me to listen to what a person is saying and process it fast enough. But I found out that I was able to learn really well in a hands on learning environment and went to a trade school. College is listening to a person talk and tests are pretty much just memorization. I don't have either of these skills.

Keep posting here and maybe read a few posts. This really helped me realize that there are other people going through the same stuff I am. 

Now I build software and a skill that helps me is to break my apps down into smaller easier tasks. It works well in life too! Instead of "clean the kitchen" I tell myself "clean one dish". After I finish one dish I'm right there and might as well clean another. Pretty soon the sink is empty.

id:e8wly7e, comment author:ler256, body:Hey, 

Your story is heartbreaking and I feel your pain. But I do bring good news, the first is that it can only get better from here, your situation is awful but there are ways to resolve it. However to resolve it you must still be here! 

You mention about moving back home and you are planning for the future, from this I know that you want to make things better. Hope isn't lost, it's well founded that you will get through this. 

So here is my attempt at answering your questions; 

I think you should be straight with you family and bf and tell them exactly how you feel, no sugar coating: "I'm thinking of killing myself". Build your support network by first asking them for help. I would then consider how much you want this college course, college isn't for everyone and there are other ways to gain skills. If sitting in a class isn't for you then explain that to your bf and look at jobs with room for developing skills. You aren't a loser, you're still living, you might be down but you ain't out, the girl still has kick. 

You asked about killing yourself without upseting your loved ones, the answer is there isn't a way to. It's why suicide is never the option, people care about you, alot and you have to fight for that, see that if you need it they will help you through this.

id:e8wuqi8, comment author:Babyy_Bluee, body:I'm sorry about everything you're going through. I only have one piece of advice to add, because I can't really say much for the debt.


There's a quote that's gone around online for years, "if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best."

I like this quote, in the context that your "worst" is you struggling, not just an excuse for being a POS.

You are struggling, and if your boyfriends only words of "encouragement," if I can call it that, are that you are a loser, he does not deserve to be with you now, let alone once you've "bettered" yourself. 
 
You can overcome this. You can consolidate your debt, you can apply for government help with housing or rent, therapy can help you feel great without having to drink or smoke. 

You've got this, tons of people are rooting for you, ups:1, downs:0, parent:9tgxgp
id:e8xbadl, comment author:talipally, body:Yeah I hear ya on everyone thinking you do well in life. (I’m literally in the exact same boat). You don’t necessarily have to tell everyone the truth, but I find that confiding in one or two people that you trust, like a cousin or a friend, often helps immensely. But if you feel that they will just judge you, than don’t tell them anything it’s not worth it.

Yeah def try Craigslist they do have legit ones on babysitting, dog walking, etc. like I said just be careful. I know uber and Lyft do have a rental car program as well for people who don’t have a car, where the more you drive, the less you pay for a rental (like as low as $5/week) so maybe that’s something to keep in mind one day?

Also try some work from home gigs, just to broaden your job search. Appen is always hiring for work from home web search evaluators (Appen.com) as well as lion bridge,  and isoftstone. Just google the company names and it’ll take you to their website and check the jobs page. You can also try freelance writing if you’re a half decent writer, that’s what I do and I literally started with 0 experience (everyone starts from the bottom). I wrote writing samples on random topics and used as a simple Google Docs portfolio piece. If you’re interested, there’s a ton of info on YouTube and through google searches.

Seriously don’t give up. Your situation is fixable and their are solutions you can implement. I’m really happy that you’re opening up about your situation, especially on Reddit, because this is the kind of place where the online community really supports one another. Me, and thousands of other Redditors will always be here if you need us. , ups:1, downs:0, parent:9tgxgp

I unfortunately don’t have a car (or my full license, I’m a terrible driver...) so Uber/Lyft isn’t an option. I never thought of looking on Craigslist though, having odd jobs to do while I’m looking for stable work would be incredibly helpful. Thanks for suggesting that! 

Your advice about trying to quit my addiction is also helpful, I’ve tried to stop cold turkey and it obviously just makes my craving 100x more intense. I’ll try to start slowing down and hopefully will stop depending on them. 


Hearing that I’m not alone is one of the most comforting things to me right now, so the cliche is fair haha! I feel really alone, I have no one to talk to about it. Literally everyone in my life currently thinks I’m doing really well in school and have a lot of money (boyfriend included). It makes me feel a lot better knowing that people have struggled with the same things I’m going through or worse, and were able to overcome it and live life.
